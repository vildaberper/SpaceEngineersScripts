## AutoInv

**DISCONTINUED**

> Powerful and efficient inventory manager with multiple levels of sorting. I created this in memory of TIM the almighty. But I want to surpass it in terms of versatility. AutoInv has its workload split up in several resumable states, so it should handle very large grids without a problem. Get it on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1675244660).
